##  delete and save last days data


```{r del}

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/"

indicies <- tail(which(foo$County=="Total"),2)

foo <- foo[1:indicies[1],]
foo <- foo[1:71,]

foo <- foo[1:440,]

# Save an accumulated file in case of a failure
saveRDS(foo,paste0("/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/",lubridate::today(),"_Covid.rds"))
# Save the real file for later use
saveRDS(foo,"/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/Covid.rds")
# Also save to mirror site
saveRDS(foo,"/home/ajackson/Dropbox/mirrors/ajackson/Covid/Covid.rds")

```

##  Delete Total field

```{r delete total}

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/"

foo <- readRDS("/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/Covid.rds")

foo <- foo %>% filter(County!="Total")

# Save an accumulated file in case of a failure

saveRDS(foo,"/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/Covid.rds")
# Also save to mirror site
saveRDS(foo,"/home/ajackson/Dropbox/mirrors/ajackson/Covid/Covid.rds")



```

##  Add Deaths field

```{r delete total}

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/"

foo <- readRDS("/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/Covid.rds")

foo <- foo %>% mutate(Deaths="-")

# Save an accumulated file in case of a failure
saveRDS(foo,paste0("/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/",lubridate::today(),"_Covid.rds"))
# Save the real file for later use
saveRDS(foo,"/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/Covid.rds")
# Also save to mirror site
saveRDS(foo,"/home/ajackson/Dropbox/mirrors/ajackson/Covid/Covid.rds")



```

##  Fix DeathData

```{r deathdata}

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/"

foo <- readRDS("/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/Deaths.rds")

foo <- foo[1:7,]

saveRDS(foo ,paste0("/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/",lubridate::today(),"_deaths.rds"))
# Save the real file for later use
saveRDS(foo,"/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/Deaths.rds")
# Also save to mirror site
saveRDS(foo,"/home/ajackson/Dropbox/mirrors/ajackson/Covid/Deaths.rds")
```

##  Add LastUpdate field

```{r deathdata}

path <- "/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/"

foo <- readRDS("/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/Covid.rds")

foo <- foo %>% 
  mutate(LastUpdate=Date) %>% 
  mutate(Deaths=str_replace(Deaths,"-", "na")) %>% 
  mutate(Deaths=as.numeric(Deaths)) %>% 
  replace_na(list(Count_ = 0, Deaths=0))

hour(foo$LastUpdate) <- 11

foo$LastUpdate <- as.character(foo$LastUpdate)


# Save the real file for later use
saveRDS(foo,"/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Covid/Covid.rds")
# Also save to mirror site
saveRDS(foo,"/home/ajackson/Dropbox/mirrors/ajackson/Covid/Covid.rds")
