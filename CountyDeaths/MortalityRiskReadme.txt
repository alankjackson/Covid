United States Life Expectancy and Age-specific Mortality Risk by County 1980-2014

Research by IHME used small area estimation methods to produce annual life tables and calculate age-specific mortality risk at the county level for the United States. De-identified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and population counts from the census bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database were used in the analysis. This dataset provides estimates for life expectancy at birth and mortality risk for under-5 and 20-year age groups at the county level for each state, the District of Columbia, and the United States as a whole for 1980-2014, as well as the changes in life expectancy and mortality risk for each location during this period. Also included are data on the 30 counties with the highest and lowest life expectancy and mortality risks. Results of the study were published in JAMA in May 2017 in "Inequalities in life expectancy among US counties, 1980â€“2014."

NOTE ABOUT MORTALITY RISK MEASURE
Mortality risk is defined as the probability of death during the specified age range conditional on being alive at the beginning of this age range.

The value given as the metric for this measure in this dataset is "Percentage." More specifically, this is the probability of the mortality risk expressed as a percentage.
